title:  "Final Thoughts as the course comes to an end"

Now that I am nearing completion of Data Science for Statisticians, I have to admit I am more confused than ever about the difference between data scientists and statisticians. The best answer I can conjure up is data science is a subset of statistics. They fill the roles that do not fully require the rigors of statistics. Other than that, in my view, they more or less possess the same knowledge and use the same tools.

As far as R is concerned, I really have begun to enjoy the language and will continue to explore all it has to offer. I was incorrect with my initial assessment that R is a statistics language rather than a
general purpose language like Python. It is just as capable of being used for general purposes as Python. I recently went back to do something in Python to work on a project and I found myself "missing" R, especially the ability to pipe. That is such and elegant and intuitive way of parsing data sets (to me at least). I will definitely use it going forward, but I will also maintain my knowledge and practice in others. I firmly believe people should not be "one trick ponies" and expand their knowledge base as much as possible. I don't think any one was ever turned down from a job because they knew too much.

Going forward, I will be using GitHub a lot. I have never used it before this course and was not sure why it was so pervasive. After attending this course, I really do appreciate what it does. I have even started moving all my previous code from Google Drive to Git. Plus, once I am better at coding, GitHub will all me to share my work with my colleagues and peers. Docker is another tool that I will try to use more of. I already tend to use VMs for some stuff, especially when I want to keep an isolated environment. But Docker seems to take that and package it in a less clunky manner. Great for sharing and archiving. APIs are a new concept for me as well. I knew about them and roughly what they are used for but this course really helped cement that. I really wanted to use an API for my project but I did not find a suitable site. 

Thanks for all the great information and awesome instruction in the past 10 weeks! I look forward to future courses.
