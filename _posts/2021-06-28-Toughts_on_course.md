title: The course so far

**How is the course going so far?**  

I really have been enjoying the course. This is the fifth course I have taken in the program and I feel this is the first one where I have found my groove as a student. Going into the course I wanted to avoid mistakes I made in past classes. Mainly around time management. I have been making sure to start assignments as soon as they are available, even before I have finished going through all the videos. Doing this sets the tone for that week's classes because I have an idea of what to expect and it gives me somewhat of a guide of what is important. Additionally, this course focuses on one of the things I really enjoy, programming. Also, I finally have an idea on how to use github. Git has always been one of those mysteries to me until now.


**What do you like about the course and what would you change about the course?**

One thing I like about this course is the inclusion of collaborative tools with version control. I think it is one of the most important parts of the course considering collaboration is something that can make or break your career. I like the way the material is being presented. The videos go in just enough detail on how to complete the required tasks but not so much that a person can get overwhelmed.

If there was anything I would change it would be to recommend a couple of reference books. There was one in the beginning, The R Cookbook maybe?, so it might help more people if there were a couple of good books that they could reference for more in depth readings (optional readings though).  


**Any other thoughts?  (I just like to hear how everyone is doing and get feedback to incorporate!**

I think it would be good to have a short video on the most common languages used in statistics/data science. I think in the program you get exposure to SAS and R, but people should also understand that Scala, Julia, Python, and even Matlab are used in this field. Maybe talk about why one is used over another, etc.
