title:  "Bike Sharing Project"
---

Recently I completed a class project with a classmate of mine for out data science class. The project involved take data from a bike sharing venture and using techniques we learned in class, analyzed the data and built a prediction model. We looked at 2 years worth of data and included in that data were things like daily weather, holidays, temperature, and humidity. More importantly, the data contained the number of daily users, registed and casual. The number of users is what we used as our reponse variable. The model that was developed attempted to predict the number of users for a given day based on some important (to the model) variables.  

**What would you do differently?**

Four models were developed altogether. Two linear, one random forest, and one boosting. Given more time and resources, I would have liked to try additional models like logistic regression. We would gave had to find a way to process the data to make it work with a logistic model. Due to time contraints and project guidance, this was not done. Also, introducing more transformations for the predictors would have allowed us to produce more linear model. The danger here being potential overfitting of models to training data.

**What was the most difficult part for you?**  

Automating the text to contian information specific for that particular day. At first, we were only going to use static generic text to describe the models and the data. But after trail and error we were able to introduce some custom descriptions. 

**What are your big take-aways from this project?**

That github is the most important tool anyone working with code can have. From version control to collaboration, I am not sure how I was able to code with it.
